    The word <b>Allah</b> has been used by Arabic people of different religions since pre-Islamic times.[9] <i>The pre-Islamic Arabs worshipped a supreme deity whom they called Allah, alongside other lesser deities.</i>[10] Muhammad used the word Allah to indicate the Islamic conception of God. Allah has been used as a term for God by Muslims (both Arab and non-Arab) and even Arab Christians[11] after the term "al-ilāh" and "Allah" were used interchangeably in Classical Arabic by the majority of Arabs who had become Muslims. It is also often, albeit not exclusively, used in this way by <small>Bábists, Baháʼís, Mandaeans, Indonesian and Maltese Christians, and Sephardi Jews</small>,[12][13][14] as well as by the Gagauz people.[15] <em>Similar usage by Christians and Sikhs in West Malaysia has recently led to political and legal controversies.</em>
